# Virtual-World-Scripts
ZenMondo's Open Source Archive for Virtual Worlds

Formerly Hosted at http://flynnos.org/FlynnOSarchive.php

Here you will find an archive of scripts I have written for use in Second Life and other virtual worlds that use Linden Scripting Language (LSL).
I hope that you find them useful. If you have any questions, find me in Second Life as ZenMondo Wormser or Email me at zenmondo@flynnos.org
